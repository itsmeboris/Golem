| --- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------------- |
| #32 | [ ]    | **Redmine/Local heartbeat Tier 1** — `poll_untagged_tasks()` returns `[]` for Redmine and Local backends; Tier 1 issue triage only works on GitHub           | Medium | P2             |

| #2  | [ ]    | **Dashboard prompt comparison UI** — table/chart for `/api/analytics/by-prompt` data (API exists, frontend missing)                                         | Low    | P3             |
| #36 | [ ]    | **CLI `logs` command** — no `golem logs` / `golem logs --follow` subcommand; `status --watch` shows counters but not log output                             | Low    | P3             |
| #37 | [ ]    | **Heartbeat state cleanup on detach** — `golem detach` removes repo from registry but leaves orphan per-repo heartbeat state files on disk                   | Low    | P3             |

| #38 | [ ]    | **Merge queue thread safety** — `snapshot()`, `pending`, `detect_overlaps()` read shared state without lock while `process_all()` mutates it concurrently    | High   | P1             |

| #40 | [ ]    | **Notifier delivery resilience** — all notifiers silently swallow exceptions; no retry, no failure signaling to orchestrator, no timeout on send operations   | High   | P2             |
| #41 | [ ]    | **Subprocess timeout gaps** — `_detect_base_branch()` and `rsync` in ensemble have no timeout; can hang indefinitely on unresponsive repos                   | Medium | P2             |
| #42 | [ ]    | **Ensemble cost budget guard** — ensemble retry spawns N parallel candidates without checking `max_cost_usd` first; can exceed budget                        | Medium | P2             |
| #43 | [ ]    | **Prompt placeholder fallbacks** — conditional placeholders (`{simplify_section}`, `{enhanced_review_section}`) render as literal text when conditions unmet  | Medium | P3             |
| #44 | [ ]    | **AGENTS.md growth bound** — `pitfall_writer._apply_decay()` never removes high-seen entries; file grows unbounded over time                                 | Medium | P3             |
| #45 | [ ]    | **Merge queue callback safety** — `on_merge_agent` callback not wrapped in try/except; exception leaves merge state inconsistent                             | Medium | P2             |
